# ðŸ§® Basic Calculator â€“ Command Line App

This is a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It was built using Python as part of my foundational programming projects.

---

## âœ¨ Project Overview

The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). It then performs the selected operation and returns the result.

The goal of this project was to understand how to:
- Work with user input in Python
- Use conditional statements to control logic
- Build interactive console-based tools

---

## ðŸ”‘ Features

- Accepts user input for two numbers and an operator
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles basic input validation
- Runs directly in the terminal

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to handle input and output in Python
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making
- Simple debugging and user-friendly messaging
- Building real-time interaction in CLI apps

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository or download the file
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder
3. Run the calculator with:

```bash
python calculator.py
